4/3/21: LightBulb night light filter Windows 10 app issues
-----------------------
- Cascading memory leak causes it to continually consume more memory with no apparent limit; left alone it went as high as 4GB before I shut it down.
- Constantly uses a whopping 30W of power!!! (measured with Kill A Watt meter)

Not sure what causes these issues; they were certainly not always the case.
