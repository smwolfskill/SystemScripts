How to Configure Speedfan:
Detecting hardware correctly
==========================
For some reason SpeedFan only detects hardware correctly if it is launched after launching CPUID's HWMonitor program.

==========================
Ramping up a chassis fan speed according to GPU temp
--------------------------
1. Open SpeedFan 4.52 and click the Configure button near the top right.
2. Under the first tab Temperatures, check and expand GPU and check the chassis
   fan desired to be associated with it.
3. Click on GPU, and set Desired and Warning temps.
4. Under the fourth tab Speeds, click on the fan(s) associated with the GPU and
   set Minimum value (1%) and Maximum value (something around 50-70%)
5. ***IMPORTANT*** Switch fan control to manual mode; this can be done either in BIOS or
   in Advanced tab, select Chip for the fan(s) (e.g. Winbond W83677HG-I...)
   and under PWM [n] mode, set Manual for each PWM fan we'd like to control with Speedfan.
6. Click OK.
7. Check 'Automatic fan speed' on the main window, and observe chassis fan(s) ramp up/down
   according to GPU temp; likely set at max or min speed.

-NOTE: Advanced fan control looked promising, but I cannot figure out how to make it work.
 It does not obey the curve set and appears to have no effect.
