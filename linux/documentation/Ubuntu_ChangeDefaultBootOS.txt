To change which OS loads at startup by default if the Grub menu times out (but always show the grub menu first),
1. Use efibootmgr on Ubuntu to make sure that Ubuntu is set as the default OS to boot:
------------
For help:
efibootmgr -h

To change the boot order: (where XXXX is Ubuntu, YYYY probably Windows)
efibootmgr --bootorder XXXX,YYYY,...

============
2. Use grubcustomizer on Ubuntu to change the default OS to boot if the Grub menu times out.
------------
sudo apt-get install grub-customizer

Launch grub customizer. Under General settings, change predefined to the desired OS.

    Under 'visibility', 'show menu' should most likely be checked (true).

===========
To confirm grub settings, look at /etc/default/grub
