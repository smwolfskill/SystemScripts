Switching AMD to NVIDIA drivers
==============================
Linux
-------
Scenario: 
1. Both AMD (amdgpu-pro) and NVIDIA drivers are installed on Ubuntu 20.04.
2. Replace single GPU slot from AMD to NVIDIA.
3. Fail to boot Ubuntu; screens continually flicker on and off.

Solution:
1. Boot into recovery mode successfully, and go to root prompt.
2. Run `amdgpu-pro-uninstall`
3. Ubuntu should now boot without issues, and without need to update/reinstall NVIDIA drivers.
4. Reinstalling amdgpu-pro with --headless argument does not break boot stability, but
   I have not tested if it can still use the AMD card in the secondary slot with this driver install.

NOTE: Changing grub config to remove AMD GPU tweaking access has no effect on boot stability. 
This issue is entirely caused by the AMD amdgpu-pro driver.
