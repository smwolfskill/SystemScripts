How to allow a user to run a script as root 
via sudo without needing a password:
(e.g. how to allow a non-root user to change the power limit
 and persistence mode for NVIDIA GPUs with nvidia-smi)
 ======================================
1. Create/copy script to /usr/local/sbin
2. `sudo chown root:root [/usr/local/sbin/myScript]`
3. `sudo chmod g-wx,o-wx [/usr/local/sbin/myScript]`
4. Edit /etc/sudoers file to allow user access w/o password:
`sudo visudo`

Copy & Paste in:

scott   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/myScript

That's it!
