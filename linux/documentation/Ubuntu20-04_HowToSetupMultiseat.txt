Ubuntu 20.04 steps (so far) to set up multiseat with GPU Passthrough with NVIDIA + AMD GPU (passthrough just AMD GPU):
----------------------------
1. Enable BIOS settings given in the guide
1.1. Disable XHCI Handoff under Advanced > USB settings. Once the iommu=pt grub option is set,
     you will be able to boot but not able to use any USB devices (mouse, keyboard) if XHCI Handoff is true.
2. Uninstall AMD's amdgpu driver and update /etc/X11/xorg.conf to comment-out any sections referring to amdgpu (i.e. device)
3. Follow guide to update grub settings and reboot
3.1. IMPORTANT: Boot into recovery mode after rebooting with "iommu=pt" to determine the IOMMU groups,
     b/c amdgpu causes large system instability/unusability with this option until it is hidden from the primary OS 
     by adding its IOMMU group(s) to be handled by the VFIO driver instead of amdgpu.
     If you attempt to regular boot Ubuntu, you will observe bizarre behavior like:
     Certain windows refuse to open, cryptic errors, amdgpu errors (`dmesg | grep -i amdgpu)` until revert grub setting "iommu=pt" back to "iommu=soft"
4. Follow guide to observe that AMD GPU is being handled by vfio driver and NOT amdgpu:
   `lspci -nnv | grep -B 10 -i "Kernel driver in use.*vfio" | less`
5. Set up network bridge with nmcli (wired Ethernet only)
6. Add "video=efifb:off" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub (do `sudo update-grub` after)
   to avoid AMD driver error 43 after driver install on VM later
6. Set up QEMU VM(s) with guide
6.1. `virsh edit [VM name]`
     To use the passed-through GPU connected to a monitor, need to comment-out (<!-- XML comment -->)
     <video> and <spice> sections referring to simulated iGPU.
7. Launch the VM, install Windows, and then install AMD Radeon drivers! Tiny resolution will be fixed.
8. After shutting down VM, remove virtual SATA disk containing Windows 10 iso.

WARNING: If mounting any drives, paths etc. on the VM, make sure they are not mounted on the host and NEVER
mount them on the host while the VM is running.
