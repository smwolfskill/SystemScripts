Fractal Design Prisma AL-12 PWM 120mm ARGB Fan: Loud whine, wobble issues
3/19/21
-----------------------------
- The fan appears to wobble in its frame at lower RPM, especially below 30-35% or so
  of its max RPM (2000)
- Coincidentally at these same RPMs and a bit above (even up to about 55-65% of max)
  it emits a loud, piercing whine at a high frequency that in some cases is even audible
  from another room, behind a closed door. 
- The typical lower-pitched white-noise fan sound gets quite louder once
  the RPMs are above 65-70% or so, but then the high-frequency whine disappears;
  the lower-pitched noise is much less irritating.
- The high-frequency whine is most pronounced at 30% RPM.
  -- A different whine is also pretty pronounced at 65%.
  
- As a result the fan seems to be more stable and also most pleasant to listen to
  in the 70-100% RPM range.
  
Overall suggested range: 40-55%.
- Best RPMs:
-- 40%: Suggested min RPM


- Tolerable RPMs:
-- 50-55%: A bit more whine than 40% but not too bad.
-- 70%: Not the most pleasant but not as bad as 75% or 65%.
-- 90-100%: Typical lower-pitched fan noise is quite loud, but less whine.
   Still pretty bad at times depending on where you stand.

- Worst RPMs:
-- 30% and under: by far
-- 60-65%: different high-pitched whine; piercing. Can hear from other rooms.
-- 75%: Still has a faint high-pitched whine, but the louder typical fan sound
   mostly drowns it out.
-- 80-85%: Still hear high-pitched whine like 75%, but even louder typical fan sound
   on top of it.
