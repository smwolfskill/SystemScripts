CLI to change NVIDIA Settings:
In this example, sets:
- Power Limit 125W
- Mem Clock +2400 (shows as +1200 in GreenWithEnvy)
- Core Clock -50
- Manual Fan Control (1)
- Fan Speed 80%

NOTE: Exiting GreenWithEnvy resets NVIDIA settings back to default! (not even what's in the .nvidia-settings-rc file!)
=========================
sudo nvidia-smi -pl 125
nvidia-settings -a GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[4]=2400
nvidia-settings -a GPUGraphicsClockOffset[4]=-50
nvidia-settings -a GPUFanControlState=1
nvidia-settings -a GPUTargetFanSpeed=80
-------------------------
Or, inside ~/.nvidia-settings-rc enter under Attributes:
NOTE: These only activate after user login, not during boot.
(You can put nvidia-smi commands but NOT nvidia-settings commands into a systemd auto-run
service at boot. This is because nvidia-settings commands must have a display,
which only initializes after a user logs in)
- This is potentially problematic because the fan speed won't be set until after login
 and could overheat! Need a way to have the display manager run the script after boot
 and display initialization but before logging in.
 
 
 
--------------------------
# Custom OC:
GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[4]=2400
GPUGraphicsClockOffset[4]=-50
GPUFanControlState=1
GPUTargetFanSpeed=80
# End Custom OC

and then
nvidia-settings --load-config-only &

to manually reload, or enter the above line inside /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
to load upon startup for all users (UNTESTED)

Update 1/17/22: changing xinitrc DOES NOT WORK because on
Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 the display-manager used is gdm3 which does not
use the xinitrc file at all; this is only relevant to certain other display managers. See /etc/gdm3/PreSession/Default script instead.
